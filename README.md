# Boston Crime Analysis

In this project, I carried out some analysis on Boston Crime dataset, which was obtained from Crime Incident Reports, provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) Source: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system

**The objective of the project** is to help both residents and visitors stay safer, and Boston Police identify crime hotspots, better anticipate staffing needs and improve security in menacing areas. 

**These are research questions for the project:**

•  Determine the most common crimes in Boston

• Determine the most dangerous time of year and in a day in Boston

• Identify the places (District and Street) where crimes are most likely to be committed

• Crimes related to Shooting analysis

• Incidents in Boston during Covid pandemic analysis

• Crimes at Northeastern University area analysis

**In this project, I followed the workflow of five main stages:**

1. Question or problem definition and hypotheses
 
2. Acquire dataset
 
3. Wrangle, prepare and cleanse the data
 
4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data
 
5. Visualize, report, and present the problem-solving steps and final solution
