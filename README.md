# Boston Crime Analysis

In this project, I carried out some analysis on Boston Crime dataset, which was obtained from Crime Incident Reports, provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) Source: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system

**The objective of the project** is to help both residents and visitors stay safer, and Boston Police identify crime hotspots, better anticipate staffing needs and improve security in menacing areas. 

**These are research questions for the project:**
•  Determine the most common crimes in Boston
• Determine the most dangerous time of year and in a day in Boston
• Identify the places (District and Street) where crimes are most likely to be committed
• Crimes related to Shooting analysis
• Incidents in Boston during Covid pandemic analysis
• Crimes at Northeastern University area analysis
